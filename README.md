# Personal Dotfiles

## Installation

Clone this repo and run `install.sh` script.
This will symlink the dotfiles into your home directory. Then it will try to install some necessary packages.

You may want to install a [nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) in order to see proper icons.
